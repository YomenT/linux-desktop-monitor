# 🎯 App Successfully Deployed!

## ✅ What Just Happened

Your **Linux Desktop Monitor** app is now running on your Ubuntu Touch device!

## 📱 Testing the App

### On Your Phone:
1. Open the "Linux Desktop Monitor" app
2. You should see a form with fields for:
   - Hostname or IP address
   - Username
   - Password  
   - Port (default 22)

### On Your Desktop:
1. **Start SSH server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start sshd
   sudo systemctl enable sshd
   ```

2. **Find your desktop's IP address**:
   ```bash
   ip addr show | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```
   Look for something like `192.168.1.100`

3. **Test SSH is working**:
   ```bash
   ssh yourusername@localhost
   ```

### Connect from the App:
1. Enter your desktop's IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
2. Enter your username
3. Enter your password
4. Tap "Connect"

## 🐛 If the App Crashes

The app might need `python3` and `sshpass` installed on your device.

### Install Dependencies on Ubuntu Touch:

```bash
# Connect to your device via SSH
ssh phablet@<device-ip>

# Make filesystem writable
sudo mount -o remount,rw /

# Install packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 sshpass

# Make filesystem read-only again
sudo mount -o remount,ro /
```

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check if app is running:
```bash
clickable logs
```

### View debug output from C++:
The app logs to system journal. Key messages to look for:
- "App path:" - shows where the app is installed
- "Loading QML from:" - shows QML file location  
- "QML file exists:" - confirms QML file is found

### Common Issues:

**"ReferenceError: sshManager is not defined"**
- Fixed in latest version - rebuild and redeploy

**"module SSHManager is not installed"**
- Fixed - using context property instead of QML module

**Segmentation fault**
- Check that dependencies are installed on device

**Connection fails**
- Ensure SSH is running on desktop
- Check firewall settings
- Verify network connectivity
- Try `ping` from phone to desktop

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You know it's working when:
- App opens and shows the connection form
- No crash when tapping "Connect" 
- Status changes to "Connecting..."
- Eventually shows "Connected successfully!" with system info

## 📊 Expected Output

When connected, you'll see:
- **Hostname**: Your desktop's name
- **Uptime**: How long desktop has been running
- **CPU Usage**: Current CPU percentage
- **RAM Usage**: Memory usage (e.g., "4.2G/16G (26%)")
- **Temperature**: CPU temperature (if sensors installed)

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once it's working:
1. Test the "Refresh" button
2. Try connecting to different machines
3. Add more features (shutdown button, file transfer, etc.)
4. Polish the UI
5. Publish to OpenStore!

## 💡 Tips

- Settings are saved - you don't need to re-enter credentials each time
- The app uses your actual SSH credentials - keep them secure
- Consider adding SSH key support instead of passwords for better security
