# Linux Desktop Monitor

A tool to monitor and manage your Linux desktop from your Ubuntu Touch device via a lightweight HTTP server.

## Features

- üîå Connect to your Linux desktop via HTTP (no SSH required!)
- üìä Real-time system metrics:
  - Hostname
  - Uptime
  - CPU usage
  - RAM usage
  - Temperature (if available)
- üìÅ File browser to explore your desktop files
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Download files from desktop to your Ubuntu Touch device
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload files from Ubuntu Touch to your desktop
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Remote shutdown capability
- üîí Optional authentication token for security
- üîÑ Refresh metrics on demand
- üíæ Saves connection settings

## Building and Testing

### Prerequisites

- Clickable installed on your development machine
- Ubuntu Touch device or emulator

### Build and Install

```bash
cd linux-desktop-monitor
clickable
```

This will build the app and install it on your device/emulator.

### Desktop Setup

Download the server script from the app's documentation or GitHub repository, then run it on your Linux desktop:

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip3 install pillow pyautogui --break-system-packages

# Basic usage (no authentication)
python3 desktop_monitor_server.py

# With authentication token
python3 desktop_monitor_server.py --token mysecrettoken123

# Custom port
python3 desktop_monitor_server.py --port 9090

# Custom file root directory
python3 desktop_monitor_server.py --files-root ~/Documents
```

The server will display your IP address that you'll use in the app.

**Note**: The `--break-system-packages` flag is required on modern Linux distributions (Python 3.11+) and is safe for these user-space libraries.

**Optional: Install sensors for temperature monitoring**
```bash
sudo apt install lm-sensors
sudo sensors-detect
```

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies on your desktop**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install pillow pyautogui --break-system-packages
   ```

2. **Start the server on your desktop**: 
   ```bash
   python3 desktop_monitor_server.py
   ```

3. **Open the app on your Ubuntu Touch device**

4. **Enter your desktop's IP address and port** (default: 8080)

5. **Optional**: Enter authentication token if you started the server with `--token`

6. **Tap "Connect"** to view system metrics

7. **Browse Files**: Explore your desktop files, download to your device

8. **Upload Files**: Send files from your device to your desktop

9. **Shutdown**: Remotely shutdown your desktop when needed

## Current Status

**Version 1.0.0** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ System monitoring (CPU, RAM, uptime, temperature)
- ‚úÖ File browser with navigation
- ‚úÖ Download files from desktop to device
- ‚úÖ Upload files from device to desktop
- ‚úÖ Remote shutdown capability
- ‚úÖ Optional authentication token
- ‚úÖ Connection settings persistence

**Future Features** (Planned)
- Multiple desktop profiles
- Background monitoring with notifications
- Scheduled tasks

## Development Notes

This app uses a **client-server architecture**:

- **Frontend**: QML + C++ (Qt5) for the Ubuntu Touch app
- **Backend**: Python HTTP server (`desktop_monitor_server.py`) running on your desktop
- **Communication**: HTTP/JSON API with base64 file encoding
- **Build system**: Clickable (handles all packaging automatically)
- **Security**: Works perfectly with Ubuntu Touch's AppArmor confinement model

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection failed"**
- Verify the server is running on your desktop
- Check firewall settings (port 8080 by default must be open)
- Ensure you entered the correct IP address
- If using authentication, verify the token matches

**"Network error"**
- Ensure both devices are on the same network
- Check if you can ping the desktop from your phone
- Try accessing `http://DESKTOP_IP:8080/metrics` from a browser

**"File operation error"**
- Files can only be uploaded from the app's folder due to Ubuntu Touch permissions
- Download a file to the app first, then you can upload it back
- Check the debug logs for detailed error messages
