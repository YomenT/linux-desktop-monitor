# Linux Desktop Monitor

A tool to monitor and manage your Linux desktop from your Ubuntu Touch device via SSH.

## Features

- ðŸ”Œ SSH connection to your Linux desktop
- ðŸ“Š Real-time system metrics:
  - Hostname
  - Uptime
  - CPU usage
  - RAM usage
  - Temperature (if available)
- ðŸ”„ Refresh metrics on demand
- ðŸ’¾ Saves connection settings

## Building and Testing

### Prerequisites

- Clickable installed on your development machine
- Ubuntu Touch device or emulator

### Build and Install

```bash
cd linux-desktop-monitor
clickable
```

This will build the app and install it on your device/emulator.

### Desktop Setup

Your Linux desktop needs to have SSH server running:

```bash
# Install SSH server (if not already installed)
sudo apt install openssh-server

# Start SSH service
sudo systemctl start sshd
sudo systemctl enable sshd

# Optional: Install sensors for temperature monitoring
sudo apt install lm-sensors
sudo sensors-detect
```

## Usage

1. Open the app on your Ubuntu Touch device
2. Enter your desktop's:
   - Hostname or IP address
   - SSH username
   - SSH password
   - Port (default: 22)
3. Tap "Connect"
4. View your system metrics
5. Use "Refresh" to update the information

## Current Status

**Phase 1: Basic Monitoring** âœ…
- UI for SSH connection
- Python script for fetching metrics
- Display system information

**Phase 2: Advanced Features** (Planned)
- Remote shutdown capability
- File transfer between devices
- Multiple desktop profiles
- Background monitoring with notifications

## Development Notes

This is a **QML-only app** with a Python helper script for SSH operations. The architecture:

- **Frontend**: QML (similar to web development - HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Backend**: Python script using `sshpass` for SSH
- **Build system**: Clickable (handles all packaging automatically)

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection failed"**
- Verify SSH is running on your desktop
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure credentials are correct
- Try connecting from terminal: `ssh username@hostname`

**"Network error"**
- Ensure both devices are on the same network
- Check if you can ping the desktop from your phone
